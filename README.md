# Corner-Grocer-project

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project required you to make a program for the Corner Grocer store. This program used a combination of Python and C++ to count the frequeny of items and the amount of times they were purchased. I used python code to calculate the frequency of every word that appears from the item text file. 
Then I made a code to find the frequency of a specific word while also using python. I created a frequency.dat file to  write the words and their frequencies. I use C++ to call the functions written in python and display the frequency.dat file and a histogram.

                               
                                
What did you do particularly well?

Something I did well was writing python code to open and read item.txt file and then writing on frequency.dat file.

                               
                                
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think i can made my program better by adding menu option depending on what the user would like to do.


                             
                              
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part was writing the display frequency.dat file as a text-based histogram. When I put the item inside the for loop
for example :
Potatoes 4---> the output was

Potatoes *

Potatoes * 

Potatoes * 

Potatoes *

after that I figure the problem and fix it by display item before the for loop.


                             
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills from this project that can be used in future projects is using two languges to write a program and using data from text file. 

                                
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

using simple code and adding  in-line comments to identify each function and code. free syntax error all these make my program readable and understantable .
